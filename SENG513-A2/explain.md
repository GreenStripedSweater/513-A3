Three complex parts of my code would be in the maze.js file

the functions that I used chatgpt for were:

isColliding & checkTreasureCollisions

this function required a lot of reworking because I kept being able to run into walls
and I kept running into treasures as well
the function moveBoxes()

I wanted the movement to be smooth, and so that both players were able to move at the same time so there were a lot of things that needed to go into this
but the difficult part was checking the treasure collisions
and creating a counter fucntion for it updateCounter()
Majority of my help for the code came from chatgpt
