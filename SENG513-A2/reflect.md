- I learned how useful the console.log was, it helped my identify a lot of the problems I was having, which I was able to tell chatgpt
- there were a few times that the bot wasn't able to fix my code, so I had to check things manually
- one part I had to check manually was why my players were hitting the walls at different places instead of right against the div, so I had to make sure there wasn't any extra stuff added to my divs, I learned that it just had to do withthe containers border size
- With Ai I learned that being conscise is the most important and not to flood it with things it doens't need to help solve your problem otherwise it can be overwhelming for it and for yourself
